# codingG4m3 Front-end Developer Assessment
The assessment is divided into two parts: written responses and coding exercises.
To complete the assessment:
- clone this repository
- complete the tasks listed below
- create your own git repo using the name format \[your-name\]-codingG4m3
- email your repository link to rodrigo@processmaker.com
## Part 1: Write the responses

### Question 1: Find the errors

Review the sample HTML in `game-1/buggy.html`. Identify as many errors / mistakes as you can, related to HTML/CSS/Javascript. As this is part of the written assessment, we prefer you to describe the problems in plain English - and explain how they can be fixed.

### Question 2: test the JS and tell us what is the result

Review the sample JS in `game-2/test.js`. run this script and tell us if the code works and what is the result.

**Submitting**

To submit this answer, create a file in the `game-2` folder titled `answer.md` (.txt format is also acceptable).



## Part 2: Coding

This part of the assessment will test your grasp of fundamental aspects of front-end development, and your competency with HTML, CSS, and Javascript. We will be looking at: 

- accuracy / completeness (did you meet all the requirements of the task?)
- code quality / format (is your code easy to read, written with best practices?)
- browser compatibility (how well does your code work on different devices and browsers?)

**Submitting Exercises**

Although we provide Submitting instructions for each exercise, we understand if you wish to create your own folder structure/build environment for the coding exercises. This is fine as long as they are well-organized and clearly documented.

**Preprocessors and Frameworks**

Please use Vue.js

CSS can be written as basic CSS, or using preprocessors like SASS, SCSS, or PostCSS

### Exercise 1: PokeCard

In this assignment you will use javascript Vue.js to fetch data from the [PokeAPI](https://pokeapi.co/) and display it to the user. 

A basic example is demonstrated in the screenshot below:

**Requirements**


- Create Vue.js compoent to display the card.
- The Types (if there are more than one) should be presented in one comma-separated string.
- Your code should be able to run on a local development server like [http-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server)

**Other notes**
- If you use other build tools, please provide documentation and place it in the `coding-1` folder as `pokeCard-readme.md` (.txt format also acceptable)

- It is up to you to determine how to handle issues like client-side validation and error handling.

**Submitting** 

Any files you create for this project should be placed into the `coding-1` folder along with any readme or instructions you wish to provide.
